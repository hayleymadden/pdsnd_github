# Explore US Bikeshare Data
**Created by Hayley Madden June 2023**
This simple command line Python program was created to demonstrate understanding of concepts taught in Udacity's _Programming for Data Science with Python_ course.  The script prompts a user to select predetermined inputs to calculate statistics derived from raw bikeshare data across three US cities.

## Getting Started
**Software Prerequisites**
- Git [(download)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Python [(download)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Files Used**
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

**Installation & Launch**
Clone repository:  `$ git clone https://github.com/hayleymadden/pdsnd_github`
Navigate to local directory
Execute program: `$ python bikeshare_final2.py`
Follow prompts


## Known Bugs
Raw data for the city of Washington does include data for User Birth Year or User Gender. User receives message acknowledging absent data in lieu of calculated statistic - see lines 182 and 194 of bikeshare_final2.py
## Collaboration and Further Development
This program is not currently accepting pull requets as its primary purpose is to demonstrate understanding of concepts covered in Udacity's _Programming for Data Science with Python_ course.
